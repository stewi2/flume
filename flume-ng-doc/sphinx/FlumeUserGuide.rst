Flume 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT User Guide
======================================

Introduction
============

Overview
--------

Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for efficiently
collecting, aggregating and moving large amounts of log data from many
different sources to a centralized data store.

Apache Flume is a top level project at the Apache Software Foundation.
There are currently two release code lines available, versions 0.9.x and 1.x.
This documentation applies to the 1.x codeline.
Please click here for
`the Flume 0.9.x User Guide <http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh/3/flume/UserGuide/>`_.

System Requirements
-------------------

TBD

Architecture
------------

Data flow model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Flume event is defined as a unit of data flow having a byte payload and an
optional set of string attributes. A Flume agent is a (JVM) process that hosts
the components through which events flow from an external source to the next
destination (hop).

.. figure:: images/UserGuide_image00.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Agent component diagram

A Flume source consumes events delivered to it by an external source like a web
server. The external source sends events to Flume in a format that is
recognized by the target Flume source. For example, an Avro Flume source can be
used to receive Avro events from Avro clients or other Flume agents in the flow
that send events from an Avro sink. When a Flume source receives an event, it
stores it into one or more channels. The channel is a passive store that keeps
the event until it's consumed by a Flume sink. The JDBC channel is one example
-- it uses a filesystem backed embedded database. The sink removes the event
from the channel and puts it into an external repository like HDFS (via Flume
HDFS sink) or forwards it to the Flume source of the next Flume agent (next
hop) in the flow. The source and sink within the given agent run asynchronously
with the events staged in the channel.

Complex flows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flume allows a user to build multi-hop flows where events travel through
multiple agents before reaching the final destination. It also allows fan-in
and fan-out flows, contextual routing and backup routes (fail-over) for failed
hops.

Reliability
~~~~~~~~~~~

The events are staged in a channel on each agent. The events are then delivered
to the next agent or terminal repository (like HDFS) in the flow. The events
are removed from a channel only after they are stored in the channel of next
agent or in the terminal repository. This is a how the single-hop message
delivery semantics in Flume provide end-to-end reliability of the flow.

Flume uses a transactional approach to guarantee the reliable delivery of the
events. The sources and sinks encapsulate in a transaction the
storage/retrieval, respectively, of the events placed in or provided by a
transaction provided by the channel.  This ensures that the set of events are
reliably passed from point to point in the flow. In the case of a multi-hop
flow, the sink from the previous hop and the source from the next hop both have
their transactions running to ensure that the data is safely stored in the
channel of the next hop.

Recoverability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The events are staged in the channel, which manages recovery from failure.
Flume supports a durable JDBC channel which is backed by a relational database.
There's also a memory channel which simply stores the events in an in-memory
queue, which is faster but any events still left in the memory channel when an
agent process dies can't be recovered.

Setup
=====

Setting up an agent
-------------------

Flume agent configuration is stored in a local configuration file.  This is a
text file which has a format follows the Java properties file format.
Configurations for one or more agents can be specified in the same
configuration file. The configuration file includes properties of each source,
sink and channel in an agent and how they are wired together to form data
flows.

Configuring individual components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each component (source, sink or channel) in the flow has a name, type, and set
of properties that are specific to the type and instantiation. For example, an
Avro source needs a hostname (or IP address) and a port number to receive data
from. A memory channel can have max queue size ("capacity"), and an HDFS sink
needs to know the file system URI, path to create files, frequency of file
rotation ("hdfs.rollInterval") etc. All such attributes of a component needs to
be set in the properties file of the hosting Flume agent.

Wiring the pieces together
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The agent needs to know what individual components to load and how they are
connected in order to constitute the flow. This is done by listing the names of
each of the sources, sinks and channels in the agent, and then specifying the
connecting channel for each sink and source. For example, a agent flows events
from an Avro source called avroWeb to HDFS sink hdfs-cluster1 via a JDBC
channel called jdbc-channel. The configuration file will contain names of these
components and jdbc-channel as a shared channel for both avroWeb source and
hdfs-cluster1 sink.

Starting an agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An agent is started using a shell script called flume-ng which is located in
the bin directory of the Flume distribution. You need to specify the agent
name, the config directory, and the config file on the command line::

  $ bin/flume-ng agent -n $agent_name -c conf -f conf/flume-conf.properties.template

Now the agent will start running source and sinks configured in the given
properties file.

A simple example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here, we give an example configuration file, describing a single-node Flume deployment. This configuration lets a user generate events and subsequently logs them to the console.

.. code-block:: properties

  # example.conf: A single-node Flume configuration

  # Name the components on this agent
  agent1.sources = source1
  agent1.sinks = sink1
  agent1.channels = channel1

  # Describe/configure source1
  agent1.sources.source1.type = netcat
  agent1.sources.source1.bind = localhost
  agent1.sources.source1.port = 44444

  # Describe sink1
  agent1.sinks.sink1.type = logger

  # Use a channel which buffers events in memory
  agent1.channels.channel1.type = memory
  agent1.channels.channel1.capacity = 1000
  agent1.channels.channel1.transactionCapactiy = 100

  # Bind the source and sink to the channel
  agent1.sources.source1.channels = channel1
  agent1.sinks.sink1.channel = channel1

This configuration defines a single agent, called *agent1*. *agent1* has a source that listens for data on port 44444, a channel that buffers event data in memory, and a sink that logs event data to the console. The configuration file names the various components, then describes their types and configuration parameters. A given configuration file might define several named agents; when a given Flume process is launched a flag is passed telling it which named agent to manifest.

Given this configuration file, we can start Flume as follows::

  $ bin/flume-ng agent --conf-file example.conf --name agent1 -Dflume.root.logger=INFO,console

Note that in a full deployment we would typically include one more option: ``--conf=<conf-dir>``. The ``<conf-dir>`` directory would include a shell script *flume-env.sh* and potentially a log4j properties file. In this example, we pass a Java option to force Flume to log to the console and we go without a custom environment script.

From a separate terminal, we can then telnet port 44444 and send Flume an event:

.. code-block:: properties

  $ telnet localhost 44444
  Trying 127.0.0.1...
  Connected to localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1).
  Escape character is '^]'.
  Hello world! <ENTER>
  OK

The original Flume terminal will output the event in a log message.

.. code-block:: properties

  12/06/19 15:32:19 INFO source.NetcatSource: Source starting
  12/06/19 15:32:19 INFO source.NetcatSource: Created serverSocket:sun.nio.ch.ServerSocketChannelImpl[/127.0.0.1:44444]
  12/06/19 15:32:34 INFO sink.LoggerSink: Event: { headers:{} body: 48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 77 6F 72 6C 64 21 0D          Hello world!. }

Congratulations - you've successfully configured and deployed a Flume agent! Subsequent sections cover agent configuration in much more detail.

Data ingestion
--------------

Flume supports a number of mechanisms to ingest data from external sources.

RPC
~~~

An Avro client included in the Flume distribution can send a given file to
Flume Avro source using avro RPC mechanism::

  $ bin/flume-ng avro-client -H localhost -p 41414 -F /usr/logs/log.10

The above command will send the contents of /usr/logs/log.10 to to the Flume
source listening on that ports.

Executing commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There's an exec source that executes a given command and consumes the output. A
single 'line' of output ie. text followed by carriage return ('\\r') or line
feed ('\\n') or both together.

.. note:: Flume does not support tail as a source. One can wrap the tail command in an exec source to stream the file.

Network streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flume supports the following mechanisms to read data from popular log stream
types, such as:

#. Avro
#. Syslog
#. Netcat

Setting multi-agent flow
------------------------

.. figure:: images/UserGuide_image03.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Two agents communicating over Avro RPC

In order to flow the data across multiple agents or hops, the sink of the
previous agent and source of the current hop need to be avro type with the sink
pointing to the hostname (or IP address) and port of the source.

Consolidation
-------------

A very common scenario in log collection is a large number of log producing
clients sending data to a few consumer agents that are attached to the storage
subsystem. For examples, logs collected from hundreds of web servers sent to a
dozen of agents that write to HDFS cluster.

.. figure:: images/UserGuide_image02.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A fan-in flow using Avro RPC to consolidate events in one place

This can be achieved in Flume by configuring a number of first tier agents with
an avro sink, all pointing to an avro source of single agent. This source on
the second tier agent consolidates the received events into a single channel
which is consumed by a sink to its final destination.

Multiplexing the flow
---------------------

Flume supports multiplexing the event flow to one or more destinations. This is
achieved by defining a flow multiplexer that can replicate or selectively route
an event to one or more channels.

.. figure:: images/UserGuide_image01.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A fan-out flow using a (multiplexing) channel selector

The above example shows a source from agent "foo" fanning out the flow to three
different channels. This fan out can be replicating or multiplexing. In case of
replicating flow, each event is sent to all three channels. For the
multiplexing case, an event is delivered to a subset of available channels when
an event's attribute matches a preconfigured value. For example, if an event
attribute called "txnType" is set to "customer", then it should go to channel1
and channel3, if it's "vendor" then it should go to channel2, otherwise
channel3. The mapping can be set in the agent's configuration file.

Configuration
=============

As mentioned in the earlier section, Flume agent configuration is read from a
file that resembles a Java property file format with hierarchical property
settings.

Defining the flow
-----------------

To define the flow within a single agent, you need to link the sources and
sinks via a channel. You need to list the sources, sinks and channels for the
given agent, and then point the source and sink to a channel. A source instance
can specify multiple channels, but a sink instance can only specify on channel.
The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: properties

  # list the sources, sinks and channels for the agent
  <Agent>.sources = <Source>
  <Agent>.sinks = <Sink>
  <Agent>.channels = <Channel1> <Channel2>

  # set channel for source
  <Agent>.sources.<Source>.channels = <Channel1> <Channel2> ...

  # set channel for sink
  <Agent>.sinks.<Sink>.channel = <Channel1>

For example an agent named agent_foo is reading data from an external avro client and sending
it to HDFS via a memory channel. The config file weblog.config could look like:

.. code-block:: properties

  # list the sources, sinks and channels for the agent
  agent_foo.sources = avro-appserver-src-1
  agent_foo.sinks = hdfs-sink-1
  agent_foo.channels = mem-channel-1

  # set channel for source
  agent_foo.sources.avro-appserver-src-1.channels = mem-channel-1

  # set channel for sink
  agent_foo.sinks.hdfs-sink-1.channel = mem-channel-1

This will make the events flow from avro-AppSrv-source to hdfs-Cluster1-sink
through the memory channel mem-channel-1. When the agent is started with the
weblog.config as its config file, it will instantiate that flow.

Configuring individual components
---------------------------------

After defining the flow, you need to set properties of each source, sink and
channel. This is done in the same hierarchical namespace fashion where you set
the component type and other values for the properties specific to each
component:

.. code-block:: properties

  # properties for sources
  <Agent>.sources.<Source>.<someProperty> = <someValue>

  # properties for channels
  <Agent>.channel.<Channel>.<someProperty> = <someValue>

  # properties for sinks
  <Agent>.sources.<Sink>.<someProperty> = <someValue>

The property "type" needs to be set for each component for Flume to understand
what kind of object it needs to be. Each source, sink and channel type has its
own set of properties required for it to function as intended. All those need
to be set as needed. In the previous example, we have a flow from
avro-AppSrv-source to hdfs-Cluster1-sink through the memory channel
mem-channel-1. Here's an example that shows configuration of each of those
components:

.. code-block:: properties

  agent_foo.sources = avro-AppSrv-source
  agent_foo.sinks = hdfs-Cluster1-sink
  agent_foo.channels = mem-channel-1

  # set channel for sources, sinks

  # properties of avro-AppSrv-source
  agent_foo.sources.avro-AppSrv-source.type = avro
  agent_foo.sources.avro-AppSrv-source.bind = localhost
  agent_foo.sources.avro-AppSrv-source.port = 10000

  # properties of mem-channel-1
  agent_foo.channels.mem-channel-1.type = memory
  agent_foo.channels.mem-channel-1.capacity = 1000
  agent_foo.channels.mem-channel-1.transactionCapacity = 100

  # properties of hdfs-Cluster1-sink
  agent_foo.sinks.hdfs-Cluster1-sink.type = hdfs
  agent_foo.sinks.hdfs-Cluster1-sink.hdfs.path = hdfs://namenode/flume/webdata

  #...

Adding multiple flows in an agent
---------------------------------

A single Flume agent can contain several independent flows. You can list
multiple sources, sinks and channels in a config. These components can be
linked to form multiple flows:

.. code-block:: properties

  # list the sources, sinks and channels for the agent
  <Agent>.sources = <Source1> <Source2>
  <Agent>.sinks = <Sink1> <Sink2>
  <Agent>.channels = <Channel1> <Channel2>

Then you can link the sources and sinks to their corresponding channels (for
sources) of channel (for sinks) to setup two different flows. For example, if
you need to setup two flows in an agent, one going from an external avro client
to external HDFS and another from output of a tail to avro sink, then here's a
config to do that:

.. code-block:: properties

  # list the sources, sinks and channels in the agent
  agent_foo.sources = avro-AppSrv-source1 exec-tail-source2
  agent_foo.sinks = hdfs-Cluster1-sink1 avro-forward-sink2
  agent_foo.channels = mem-channel-1 jdbc-channel-2

  # flow #1 configuration
  agent_foo.sources.avro-AppSrv-source1.channels = mem-channel-1
  agent_foo.sinks.hdfs-Cluster1-sink1.channel = mem-channel-1

  # flow #2 configuration
  agent_foo.sources.exec-tail-source2.channels = jdbc-channel-2
  agent_foo.sinks.avro-forward-sink2.channel = jdbc-channel-2

Configuring a multi agent flow
------------------------------

To setup a multi-tier flow, you need to have an avro sink of first hop pointing
to avro source of the next hop. This will result in the first Flume agent
forwarding events to the next Flume agent. For example, if you are
periodically sending files (1 file per event) using avro client to a local
Flume agent, then this local agent can forward it to another agent that has the
mounted for storage.

Weblog agent config:

.. code-block:: properties

  # list sources, sinks and channels in the agent
  agent_foo.sources = avro-AppSrv-source
  agent_foo.sinks = avro-forward-sink
  agent_foo.channels = jdbc-channel

  # define the flow
  agent_foo.sources.avro-AppSrv-source.channels = jdbc-channel
  agent_foo.sinks.avro-forward-sink.channel = jdbc-channel

  # avro sink properties
  agent_foo.sources.avro-forward-sink.type = avro
  agent_foo.sources.avro-forward-sink.hostname = 10.1.1.100
  agent_foo.sources.avro-forward-sink.port = 10000

  # configure other pieces
  #...


HDFS agent config:

.. code-block:: properties

  # list sources, sinks and channels in the agent
  agent_foo.sources = avro-collection-source
  agent_foo.sinks = hdfs-sink
  agent_foo.channels = mem-channel

  # define the flow
  agent_foo.sources.avro-collection-source.channels = mem-channel
  agent_foo.sinks.hdfs-sink.channel = mem-channel

  # avro sink properties
  agent_foo.sources.avro-collection-source.type = avro
  agent_foo.sources.avro-collection-source.bind = 10.1.1.100
  agent_foo.sources.avro-collection-source.port = 10000

  # configure other pieces
  #...

Here we link the avro-forward-sink from the weblog agent to the
avro-collection-source of the hdfs agent. This will result in the events coming
from the external appserver source eventually getting stored in HDFS.



Fan out flow
------------

As discussed in previous section, Flume support fanning out the flow from one
source to multiple channels. There are two modes of fan out, replicating and
multiplexing. In the replicating flow the event is sent to all the configured
channels. In case of multiplexing, the event is sent to only a subset of
qualifying channels. To fan out the flow, one needs to specify a list of
channels for a source and the policy for the fanning it out. This is done by
adding a channel "selector" that can be replicating or multiplexing. Then
further specify the selection rules if it's a multiplexer. If you don't specify
an selector, then by default it's replicating:

.. code-block:: properties

  # List the sources, sinks and channels for the agent
  <Agent>.sources = <Source1>
  <Agent>.sinks = <Sink1> <Sink2>
  <Agent>.channels = <Channel1> <Channel2>

  # set list of channels for source (separated by space)
  <Agent>.sources.<Source1>.channels = <Channel1> <Channel2>

  # set channel for sinks
  <Agent>.sinks.<Sink1>.channel = <Channel1>
  <Agent>.sinks.<Sink2>.channel = <Channel2>

  <Agent>.sources.<Source1>.selector.type = replicating

The multiplexing select has a further set of properties to bifurcate the flow.
This requires specifying a mapping of an event attribute to a set for channel.
The selector checks for each configured attribute in the event header. If it
matches the specified value, then that event is sent to all the channels mapped
to that value. If there's no match, then the event is sent to set of channels
configured as default:

.. code-block:: properties

  # Mapping for multiplexing selector
  <Agent>.sources.<Source1>.selector.type = multiplexing
  <Agent>.sources.<Source1>.selector.header = <someHeader>
  <Agent>.sources.<Source1>.selector.mapping.<Value1> = <Channel1>
  <Agent>.sources.<Source1>.selector.mapping.<Value2> = <Channel1> <Channel2>
  <Agent>.sources.<Source1>.selector.mapping.<Value3> = <Channel2>
  #...

  <Agent>.sources.<Source1>.selector.default = <Channel2>

The mapping allows overlapping the channels for each value. The default must be
set for a multiplexing select which can also contain any number of channels.

The following example has a single flow that multiplexed to two paths. The
agent named agent_foo has a single avro source and two channels linked to two sinks:

.. code-block:: properties

  # list the sources, sinks and channels in the agent
  agent_foo.sources = avro-AppSrv-source1
  agent_foo.sinks = hdfs-Cluster1-sink1 avro-forward-sink2
  agent_foo.channels = mem-channel-1 jdbc-channel-2

  # set channels for source
  agent_foo.sources.avro-AppSrv-source1.channels = mem-channel-1 jdbc-channel-2

  # set channel for sinks
  agent_foo.sinks.hdfs-Cluster1-sink1.channel = mem-channel-1
  agent_foo.sinks.avro-forward-sink2.channel = jdbc-channel-2

  # channel selector configuration
  agent_foo.sources.avro-AppSrv-source1.selector.type = multiplexing
  agent_foo.sources.avro-AppSrv-source1.selector.header = State
  agent_foo.sources.avro-AppSrv-source1.selector.mapping.CA = mem-channel-1
  agent_foo.sources.avro-AppSrv-source1.selector.mapping.AZ = jdbc-channel-2
  agent_foo.sources.avro-AppSrv-source1.selector.mapping.NY = mem-channel-1 jdbc-channel-2
  agent_foo.sources.avro-AppSrv-source1.selector.default = mem-channel-1

The selector checks for a header called "State". If the value is "CA" then its
sent to mem-channel-1, if its "AZ" then it goes to jdbc-channel-2 or if its
"NY" then both. If the "State" header is not set or doesn't match any of the
three, then it goes to mem-channel-1 which is designated as 'default'.


Flume Sources
-------------

Avro Source
~~~~~~~~~~~

Listens on Avro port and receives events from external Avro client streams.
When paired with the built-in AvroSink on another (previous hop) Flume agent,
it can create tiered collection topologies.
Required properties are in **bold**.

==============  ===========  ===================================================
Property Name   Default      Description
==============  ===========  ===================================================
**channels**    --

interceptors    --           Space separated list of interceptors
interceptors.*
==============  ===========  ===================================================

Example for agent named **agent_foo**:

.. code-block:: properties

  agent_foo.sources = avrosource-1
  agent_foo.channels = memoryChannel-1
  agent_foo.sources.avrosource-1.type = avro
  agent_foo.sources.avrosource-1.channels = memoryChannel-1
  agent_foo.sources.avrosource-1.bind = 0.0.0.0
  agent_foo.sources.avrosource-1.port = 4141

Exec Source
~~~~~~~~~~~

Exec source runs a given Unix command on start-up and expects that process to
continuously produce data on standard out (stderr is simply discarded, unless
property logStdErr is set to true). If the process exits for any reason, the source also exits and
will produce no further data. This means configurations such as ``cat [named pipe]``
or ``tail -F [file]`` are going to produce the desired results where as ``date``
will probably not - the former two commands produce streams of data where as the
latter produces a single event and exits.

Required properties are in **bold**.

===============  ===========  ==============================================================
Property Name    Default      Description
===============  ===========  ==============================================================

===============  ===========  ==============================================================


.. warning:: The problem with ExecSource and other asynchronous sources is that the
             source can not guarantee that if there is a failure to put the event
             into the Channel the client knows about it. In such cases, the data will
             be lost. As a for instance, one of the most commonly requested features
             is the ``tail -F [file]``-like use case where an application writes
             to a log file on disk and Flume tails the file, sending each line as an
             event. While this is possible, there's an obvious problem; what happens
             if the channel fills up and Flume can't send an event? Flume has no way
             of indicating to the application writing the log file that it needs to
             retain the log or that the event hasn't been sent, for some reason. If
             this doesn't make sense, you need only know this: Your application can
             never guarantee data has been received when using a unidirectional
             asynchronous interface such as ExecSource! As an extension of this
             warning - and to be completely clear - there is absolutely zero guarantee
             of event delivery when using this source. You have been warned.

.. note:: You can use ExecSource to emulate TailSource from Flume 0.9x (flume og).
          Just use unix command ``tail -F /full/path/to/your/file``. Parameter
          -F is better in this case than -f as it will also follow file rotation.

Example for agent named **agent_foo**:

.. code-block:: properties

  agent_foo.sources = tailsource-1
  agent_foo.channels = memoryChannel-1
  agent_foo.sources.tailsource-1.type = exec
  agent_foo.sources.tailsource-1.command = tail -F /var/log/secure
  agent_foo.sources.tailsource-1.channels = memoryChannel-1

NetCat Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A netcat-like source that listens on a given port and turns each line of text
into an event. Acts like ``nc -k -l [host] [port]``. In other words,
it opens a specified port and listens for data. The expectation is that the
supplied data is newline separated text. Each line of text is turned into a
Flume event and sent via the connected channel.

  agent_foo.sources.syslogsource-1.host = localhost
  agent_foo.sources.syslogsource-1.channels = memoryChannel-1


Legacy Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The legacy sources allow a Flume 1.x agent to receive events from Flume 0.9.4
agents. It accepts events in the Flume 0.9.4 format, converts them to the Flume
1.0 format, and stores them in the connected channel. The 0.9.4 event
properties like timestamp, pri, host, nanos, etc get converted to 1.x event
header attributes. The legacy source supports both Avro and Thrift RPC
connections. To use this bridge between two Flume versions, you need to start a
Flume 1.x agent with the avroLegacy or thriftLegacy source. The 0.9.4 agent
should have the agent Sink pointing to the host/port of the 1.x agent.

.. note:: The reliability semantics of Flume 1.x are different from that of
          Flume 0.9.x. The E2E or DFO mode of a Flume 0.9.x agent will not be
          supported by the legacy source. The only supported 0.9.x mode is the
          best effort, though the reliability setting of the 1.x flow will be
          applicable to the events once they are saved into the Flume 1.x
          channel by the legacy source.

Flume Sinks
-----------

HDFS Sink
~~~~~~~~~

This sink writes events into the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). It
currently supports creating text and sequence files. It supports compression in
both file types. The files can be rolled (close current file and create a new
one) periodically based on the elapsed time or size of data or number of events.
It also buckets/partitions data by attributes like timestamp or machine
where the event originated. The HDFS directory path may contain formatting
escape sequences that will replaced by the HDFS sink to generate a
directory/file name to store the events. Using this sink requires hadoop to be
installed so that Flume can use the Hadoop jars to communicate with the HDFS
cluster. Note that a version of Hadoop that supports the sync() call is
required.

The following are the escape sequences supported:

=========  =================================================
Alias      Description
=========  =================================================
%{host}    Substitute value of event header named "host". Arbitrary header names are supported.
%t         Unix time in milliseconds
%a         locale's short weekday name (Mon, Tue, ...)
%A         locale's full weekday name (Monday, Tuesday, ...)
%b         locale's short month name (Jan, Feb, ...)
%B         locale's long month name (January, February, ...)
%c         locale's date and time (Thu Mar 3 23:05:25 2005)
%d         day of month (01)
%D         date; same as %m/%d/%y
%H         hour (00..23)
%I         hour (01..12)
%j         day of year (001..366)
%k         hour ( 0..23)
%m         month (01..12)
%M         minute (00..59)
%p         locale's equivalent of am or pm
%s         seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC
%S         second (00..59)
%y         last two digits of year (00..99)
%Y         year (2010)
%z         +hhmm numeric timezone (for example, -0400)
=========  =================================================


The file in use will have the name mangled to include ".tmp" at the end. Once
the file is closed, this extension is removed. This allows excluding partially
complete files in the directory.
Required properties are in **bold**.

.. note:: For all of the time related escape sequences, a header with the key
          "timestamp" must exist among the headers of the event. One way to add
          this automatically is to use the TimestampInterceptor.

HBaseSinks
~~~~~~~~~~

HBaseSink
'''''''''

This sink writes data to HBase. The Hbase configuration is picked up from the first
hbase-site.xml encountered in the classpath. A class implementing HbaseEventSerializer
which is specified by the configuration is used to convert the events into
HBase puts and/or increments. These puts and increments are then written
to HBase. This sink provides the same consistency guarantees as HBase,
which is currently row-wise atomicity. In the event of Hbase failing to
write certain events, the sink will replay all events in that transaction.
For convenience two serializers are provided with flume. The
SimpleHbaseEventSerializer (org.apache.flume.sink.hbase.SimpleHbaseEventSerializer)
writes the event body
as is to HBase, and optionally increments a column in Hbase. This is primarily
an example implementation. The RegexHbaseEventSerializer
(org.apache.flume.sink.hbase.RegexHbaseEventSerializer) breaks the event body
based on the given regex and writes each part into different columns.

The type is the FQCN: org.apache.flume.sink.hbase.HBaseSink.

AsyncHBaseSink
''''''''''''''

This sink writes data to HBase using an asynchronous model. A class implementing
AsyncHbaseEventSerializer
which is specified by the configuration is used to convert the events into
HBase puts and/or increments. These puts and increments are then written
to HBase. This sink provides the same consistency guarantees as HBase,
which is currently row-wise atomicity. In the event of Hbase failing to
write certain events, the sink will replay all events in that transaction.
This sink is still experimental.
The type is the FQCN: org.apache.flume.sink.hbase.AsyncHBaseSink.

Custom Sink
~~~~~~~~~~~

A custom sink is your own implementation of the Sink interface. A custom
sink's class and its dependencies must be included in the agent's classpath
when starting the Flume agent. The type of the custom sink is its FQCN.

Flume Channels
--------------

Channels are the repositories where the events are staged on a agent.
Source adds the events and Sink removes it.

Memory Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The events are stored in a an in-memory queue with configurable max size. It's
ideal for flow that needs higher throughput and prepared to lose the staged
data in the event of a agent failures.

====================  ================================  ========================================================

.. note:: By default the File Channel uses paths for checkpoint and data
          directories that are within the user home as specified above.
          As a result if you have more than one File Channel instances
          active within the agent, only one will be able to lock the
          directories and cause the other channel initialization to fail.
          It is therefore necessary that you provide explicit paths to
          all the configured channels, preferably on different disks.
          Furthermore, as file channel will sync to disk after every commit,
          coupling it with a sink/source that batches events together may
          be necessary to provide good performance where multiple disks are
          not available for checkpoint and data directories.

Flume Sink Processors
---------------------

Sink groups allow users to group multiple sinks into one entity.
Sink processors can be used to provide load balancing capabilities over all
sinks inside the group or to achieve fail over from one sink to another in
case of temporal failure.

Required properties are in **bold**.

===================  ===========  =================================================================================
Property Name        Default      Description
===================  ===========  =================================================================================
**processor.sinks**  --           Space separated list of sinks that are participating in the group
**processor.type**   ``default``  The component type name, needs to be ``default``, ``failover`` or ``load_balance``
===================  ===========  =================================================================================


Example for agent named **agent_foo**:

.. code-block:: properties

  agent_foo.sinkgroups = group1
  agent_foo.sinkgroups.group1.sinks = sink1 sink2
  agent_foo.sinkgroups.group1.processor.type = load_balance

Default Sink Processor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default sink processor accepts only a single sink. User is not forced
to create processor (sink group) for single sinks. Instead user can follow
the source - channel - sink pattern that was explained above in this user
guide.

Failover Sink Processor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Failover Sink Processor maintains a prioritized list of sinks, guaranteeing
that so long as one is available events will be processed (delivered).

The fail over mechanism works by relegating failed sinks to a pool where
they are assigned a cool down period, increasing with sequential failures
before they are retried. Once a sink successfully sends an event it is
restored to the live pool.

To configure, set a sink groups processor to ``failover`` and set
priorities for all individual sinks. All specified priorities must
be unique. Furthermore, upper limit to fail over time can be set
(in milliseconds) using ``maxpenalty`` property.

Required properties are in **bold**.

processor.maxpenalty               30000        (in millis)

  agent_foo.sinkgroups = group1
  agent_foo.sinkgroups.group1.sinks = sink1 sink2
  agent_foo.sinkgroups.group1.processor.type = failover
  agent_foo.sinkgroups.group1.processor.priority.sink1 = 5
  agent_foo.sinkgroups.group1.processor.priority.sink2 = 10
  agent_foo.sinkgroups.group1.processor.maxpenalty = 10000


Load balancing Sink Processor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Load balancing sink processor provides the ability to load-balance flow over
multiple sinks. It maintains an indexed list of active sinks on which the
load must be distributed. Implementation supports distributing load using
either via ``ROUND_ROBIN`` or via ``RANDOM`` selection mechanism. The choice
of selection mechanism defaults to ``ROUND_ROBIN`` type, but can be overridden
via configuration. Custom selection mechanisms are supported via custom
classes that inherits from ``LoadBalancingSelector``.

When invoked, this selector picks the next sink using its configured selection
mechanism and invokes it. In case the selected sink fails to deliver the event,
the processor picks the next available sink via its configured selection mechanism.
This implementation does not blacklist the failing sink and instead continues
to optimistically attempt every available sink. If all sinks invocations
result in failure, the selector propagates the failure to the sink runner.

  agent_foo.sinkgroups.group1.processor.selector = random

Custom Sink Processor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom sink processors are not supported at the moment.

Flume Interceptors
------------------

Flume has the capability to modify/drop events in-flight. This is done with the help of interceptors. Interceptors
are classes that implement ``org.apache.flume.interceptor.Interceptor`` interface. An interceptor can
modify or even drop events based on any criteria chosen by the developer of the interceptor. Flume supports
chaining of interceptors. This is made possible through by specifying the list of interceptor builder class names
in the configuration. Interceptors are specified as a whitespace separated list in the source configuration.
The order in which the interceptors are specified is the order in which they are invoked.
The list of events returned by one interceptor is passed to the next interceptor in the chain. Interceptors
can modify or drop events. If an interceptor needs to drop events, it just does not return that event in
the list that it returns. If it is to drop all events, then it simply returns an empty list. Interceptors
are named components, here is an example of how they are created through configuration:

.. code-block:: properties

  agent_foo.sources = source_foo
  agent_foo.channels = channel-1
  agent_foo.sources.source_foo.interceptors = a b
  agent_foo.sources.source_foo.interceptors.a.type = org.apache.flume.interceptor.HostInterceptor$Builder
  agent_foo.sources.source_foo.interceptors.a.preserveExisting = false
  agent_foo.sources.source_foo.interceptors.a.hostHeader = hostname
  agent_foo.sources.source_foo.interceptors.b.type = org.apache.flume.interceptor.TimestampInterceptor$Builder

Note that the interceptor builders are passed to the type config parameter. The interceptors are themselves
configurable and can be passed configuration values just like they are passed to any other configurable component.
In the above example, events are passed to the HostInterceptor first and the events returned by the HostInterceptor
are then passed along to the TimestampInterceptor.

Timestamp Interceptor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This interceptor inserts into the event headers, the time in millis at which it processes the event. This interceptor
inserts a header with key ``timestamp`` whose value is the relevant timestamp. This interceptor
can preserve an existing timestamp if it is already present in the configuration.

================  =======  ========================================================================
Property Name     Default  Description
================  =======  ========================================================================
**type**          --       The component type name, has to be ``TIMESTAMP``
preserveExisting  false    If the timestamp already exists, should it be preserved - true or false

Example for agent named **agent_foo**:

.. code-block:: properties

  agent_foo.sources = source1
  agent_foo.channels = channel1
  agent_foo.sources.source1.channels =  channel1
  agent_foo.sources.source1.type = SEQ
  agent_foo.sources.source1.interceptors = inter1
  agent_foo.sources.source1.interceptors.inter1.type = timestamp

Host Interceptor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This interceptor inserts the hostname or IP address of the host that this agent is running on. It inserts a header
with key ``host`` or a configured key whose value is the hostname or IP address of the host, based on configuration.

================  =======  ========================================================================
Property Name     Default  Description
================  =======  ========================================================================
**type**          --       The component type name, has to be ``HOST``
preserveExisting  false    If the host header already exists, should it be preserved - true or false
useIP             true     Use the IP Address if true, else use hostname.
hostHeader        host     The header key to be used.

Example for agent named **agent_foo**:

.. code-block:: properties

  agent_foo.sources = source_foo
  agent_foo.channels = channel-1
  agent_foo.sources.source_foo.interceptors = host_int
  agent_foo.sources.source_foo.interceptors.host_int.type = host
  agent_foo.sources.source_foo.interceptors.host_int.hostHeader = hostname

Static Interceptor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Static interceptor allows user to append a static header with static value to all events.

The current implementation does not allow specifying multiple headers at one time. Instead user might chain
multiple static interceptors each defining one static header.

================  =======  ========================================================================
Property Name     Default  Description
================  =======  ========================================================================
**type**          --       The component type name, has to be ``STATIC``
preserveExisting  true     If configured header already exists, should it be preserved - true or false
key               key      Name of header that should be created
value             value    Static value that should be created
================  =======  ========================================================================

Example for agent named **agent_foo**:

.. code-block:: properties

  agent_foo.sources = source1
  agent_foo.channels = channel1
  agent_foo.sources.source1.channels =  channel1
  agent_foo.sources.source1.type = SEQ
  agent_foo.sources.source1.interceptors = inter1
  agent_foo.sources.source1.interceptors.inter1.type = static
  agent_foo.sources.source1.interceptors.inter1.key = datacenter
  agent_foo.sources.source1.interceptors.inter1.value = NEW_YORK

Regex Filtering Interceptor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This interceptor filters events selectively by interpreting the event body as text and matching the text against a configured regular expression. The supplied regular expression can be used to include events or exclude events.

================  =======  ========================================================================
Property Name     Default  Description
================  =======  ========================================================================
**type**          --       The component type name has to be ``REGEX_FILTER``
regex             ".*"     Regular expression for matching against events
excludeRegex      false    If true, regex determines events to exclude, otherwise regex determines events to include.

Flume Properties
----------------

=========================  =======  ====================================================================
Property Name              Default  Description
=========================  =======  ====================================================================
flume.called.from.service  --       If this property is specified then the Flume agent will continue
                                    polling for the config file even if the config file is not found
                                    at the expected location. Otherwise, the Flume agent will terminate
                                    if the config doesn't exist at the expected location. No property
                                    value is needed when setting this property (eg, just specifying
                                    -Dflume.called.from.service is enough)
=========================  =======  ====================================================================

Property: flume.called.from.service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flume periodically polls, every 30 seconds, for changes to the specified
config file. A Flume agent loads a new configuration from the config file if
either an existing file is polled for the first time, or if an existing
file's modification date has changed since the last time it was polled.
Renaming or moving a file does not change its modification time. When a
Flume agent polls a non-existent file then one of two things happens: 1.
When the agent polls a non-existent config file for the first time, then the
agent behaves according to the flume.called.from.service property. If the
property is set, then the agent will continue polling (always at the same
period -- every 30 seconds). If the property is not set, then the agent
immediately terminates. ...OR... 2. When the agent polls a non-existent
config file and this is not the first time the file is polled, then the
agent makes no config changes for this polling period. The agent continues
polling rather than terminating.

Log4J Appender
==============

Appends Log4j events to a flume agent's avro source. A client using this
appender must have the flume-ng-sdk in the classpath (eg,
flume-ng-sdk-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar).
Required properties are in **bold**.

=============  =======  ==========================================================================
Property Name  Default  Description
=============  =======  ==========================================================================
Hostname       --       The hostname on which a remote Flume agent is running with an avro source.
Port           --       The port at which the remote Flume agent's avro source is listening.
=============  =======  ==========================================================================


Sample log4j.properties file:

.. code-block:: properties

  #...
  log4j.appender.flume = org.apache.flume.clients.log4jappender.Log4jAppender
  log4j.appender.flume.Hostname = example.com
  log4j.appender.flume.Port = 41414

  # configure a class's logger to output to the flume appender
  log4j.logger.org.example.MyClass = DEBUG,flume
  #...


Security
========

The HDFS sink supports Kerberos authentication if the underlying HDFS is
running in secure mode. Please refer to the HDFS Sink section for
configuring the HDFS sink Kerberos-related options.

Monitoring
==========

Monitoring in Flume is still a work in progress. Changes can happen very often.
Several Flume components report metrics to the JMX platform MBean server. These
metrics can be queried using Jconsole.

Ganglia Reporting
-----------------
Flume can also report these metrics to
Ganglia 3 or Ganglia 3.1 metanodes. To report metrics to Ganglia, a flume agent
must be started with this support. The Flume agent has to be started by passing
in the following parameters as system properties prefixed by ``flume.monitoring.``,
and can be specified in the flume-env.sh:

=======================  =======  =====================================================================================
Property Name            Default  Description
=======================  =======  =====================================================================================
**type**                 --       The component type name, has to be ``GANGLIA``
**hosts**                --       Comma separated list of ``hostname:port``
pollInterval             60       Time, in seconds, between consecutive reporting to ganglia server
isGanglia3               false    Ganglia server version is 3. By default, Flume sends in ganglia 3.1 format
=======================  =======  =====================================================================================

We can start Flume with Ganglia support as follows::

  $ bin/flume-ng agent --conf-file example.conf --name agent1 -Dflume.monitoring.type=GANGLIA -Dflume.monitoring.hosts=com.example:1234,com.example2:5455

Any custom flume components should use Java MBean ObjectNames which begin
with ``org.apache.flume`` for Flume to report the metrics to Ganglia. This can
be done by adding the ObjectName as follows(the name can be anything provided it
starts with ``org.apache.flume``):

.. code-block:: java

  ObjectName objName = new ObjectName("org.apache.flume." + myClassName + ":type=" + name);

  ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer().registerMBean(this, objName);

JSON Reporting
--------------
Flume can also report metrics in a JSON format. To enable reporting in JSON format, Flume hosts
a Web server on a configurable port. Flume reports metrics in the following JSON format:

.. code-block:: java

  {
  "typeName1.componentName1" : {"metric1" : "metricValue1", "metric2" : "metricValue2"},
  "typeName2.componentName2" : {"metric3" : "metricValue3", "metric4" : "metricValue4"}
  }

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: java

  {
  "CHANNEL.fileChannel":{"EventPutSuccessCount":"468085",
                        "Type":"CHANNEL",
                        "StopTime":"0",
                        "EventPutAttemptCount":"468086",
                        "ChannelSize":"233428",
                        "StartTime":"1344882233070",
                        "EventTakeSuccessCount":"458200",
                        "ChannelCapacity":"600000",
                        "EventTakeAttemptCount":"458288"},
  "CHANNEL.memChannel":{"EventPutSuccessCount":"22948908",
                     "Type":"CHANNEL",
                     "StopTime":"0",
                     "EventPutAttemptCount":"22948908",
                     "ChannelSize":"5",
                     "StartTime":"1344882209413",
                     "EventTakeSuccessCount":"22948900",
                     "ChannelCapacity":"100",
                     "EventTakeAttemptCount":"22948908"}
  }

=======================  =======  =====================================================================================
Property Name            Default  Description
=======================  =======  =====================================================================================
**type**                 --       The component type name, has to be ``HTTP``
port                     41414    The port to start the server on.
=======================  =======  =====================================================================================

We can start Flume with Ganglia support as follows::

  $ bin/flume-ng agent --conf-file example.conf --name agent1 -Dflume.monitoring.type=HTTP -Dflume.monitoring.port=34545

Metrics will then be available at **http://<hostname>:<port>/metrics** webpage.
Custom components can report metrics as mentioned in the Ganglia section above.

Custom Reporting
----------------
It is possible to report metrics to other systems by writing servers that do
the reporting. Any reporting class has to implement the interface,
``org.apache.flume.instrumentation.MonitorService``. Such a class can be used
the same way the GangliaServer is used for reporting. They can poll the platform
mbean server to poll the mbeans for metrics. For example, if an HTTP
monitoring service called ``HTTPReporting`` can be used as follows::

  $ bin/flume-ng agent --conf-file example.conf --name agent1 -Dflume.monitoring.type=com.example.reporting.HTTPReporting -Dflume.monitoring.node=com.example:332

=======================  =======  ========================================
Property Name            Default  Description
=======================  =======  ========================================
**type**                 --       The component type name, has to be FQCN
=======================  =======  ========================================



Troubleshooting
===============

Handling agent failures
-----------------------

If the Flume agent goes down then the all the flows hosted on that agent are
aborted. Once the agent is restarted, then flow will resume. The flow using
jdbc or other stable channel will resume processing events where it left
off. If the agent can't be restarted on the same, then there an option to
migrate the database to another hardware and setup a new Flume agent that
can resume processing the events saved in the db. The database HA futures
can be leveraged to move the Flume agent to another host.
